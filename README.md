# Matrix Code Rain & RAYCASTING
Text based raycasting engine that uses matrix code rain to draw walls

# Demo

# Important note
The FPS is miserable despite the fact raycaster itself uses adopted Bresenham's algorithm.
If anyone knows how to improve the performance please feel free to make a pool request.
